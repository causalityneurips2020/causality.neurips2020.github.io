										<p style="text-align:justify"> Causality is a fundamental notion in science and engineering.
											Much attention has been paid to the estimation of causal effects, where the causal structure
											is assumed to be given. This raises an important question: how can we find causal structure or
											causal models? Accordingly, one focus of this workshop is on <b2><i> causal discovery </i></b2>, i.e., how can we
											discover causal structure over a set of variables from observational data with automated procedures.
											Another focus is on <b2><i> how a causal perspective may help understand and solve advanced machine learning
											problems</i></b2>.
										 </p>



										<p  style="text-align:justify"> Recent years have seen impressive progress in theoretical and algorithmic
											developments of causal discovery from various types of data (e.g., from i.i.d. data, under distribution
											shifts or in nonstationary settings, under latent confounding or selection bias, or with missing data),
											as well as in practical applications (such as in neuroscience, climate, biology, and epidemiology).
											However, many practical issues, including confounding, large scale of the data, the presence of
											measurement error, and complex causal mechanisms, are still to be properly addressed, to achieve
											reliable causal discovery in practice.
										</p>

										<p  style="text-align:justify"> Moreover, causality-inspired machine learning (in the context of transfer learning,
										reinforcement learning, deep learning, etc.) leverages ideas from causality to improve generalization,
										robustness, interpretability, and sample efficiency and is attracting more and more interests in
										Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence. Despite the benefit of the causal view in transfer
										learning and reinforcement learning, some tasks in ML, such as dealing with adversarial attacks and
										learning disentangled representations, are closely related to the causal view but are currently
										underexplored, and cross-disciplinary efforts may facilitate the anticipated progress.
										</p>

										<p  style="text-align:justify"> This workshop aims to provide a forum for discussion for researchers
											and practitioners in machine learning, statistics, healthcare, and other disciplines to share their
											recent research in causal discovery and to explore the possibility of interdisciplinary collaboration.
											We also particularly encourage real applications, such as in neuroscience, biology, and climate science,
											of causal discovery methods.

	including but not limited to:
		<ul style="text-align:left">
		<li> Causal discovery in complex environments, e.g., in the presence of distribution shifts,
			latent confounders, selection bias, cycles, measurement error, small samples, or missing data </li>
		<li> Efficient causal discovery in large-scale datasets </li>
<li>Real-world applications of causal discovery, e.g. in neuroscience, finance, climate, and biology</li>

	</ul>
</P>

	<p style="text-align:justify">
		Submitted papers should follow the requirements for NeurIPS 2020 submissions. The length of submissions
		is flexible, but is limited to eight content pages, including all figures and tables; additional pages
		containing only references are allowed. Please format your submission using the NeurIPS 2020 LaTeX style
		file. If needed, authors may additionally submit a supplementary material. According to the workshop
		guidance provided by the conference, “work that is presented at the main NeurIPS conference should not
		appear in a workshop, including as part of an invited talk.”
    </P>

	<p style="text-align:justify">
	For the <b2>dataset track</b2>, we invite submissions of datasets from various fields, e.g., neuroscience, biology,
	finance, and climate, that are appropriate for evaluating the performance of causal discovery methods.
	Submissions should include (1) the collected dataset (the file or a link is required) and (2) a description
	of the dataset in PDF format (with NeurIPS 2020 LaTeX style file), limited to four pages. The description
	should include the “ground truth” causal structure from domain knowledge or experiments and the testing
	results of at least one causal discovery method.
    </P>

	<p style="text-align:justify">
	All accepted papers and datasets will be available on the workshop website. According to the feedback
		from authors, we will further decide whether to publish selected papers in proceedings or a journal
		special issue.
    </P>

		<h2>Schedule</h2>
	</header>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
		The workshop will consist of four main parts: pre-recorded invited talks with a live discussion,
		pre-recorded contributed presentations with a live discussion, a virtual poster session with spotlight
		talks, and, to conclude, a panel discussion. We will have seven invited talks, covering recent
		developments in causal discovery and inference, the connection between causal modeling and machine
		learning, and applications of causal analysis. Importantly, we will make all videos available on our
		website one week before the workshop, so attendees in all time zones can watch them beforehand and
		submit questions. To transfer the social and forum-like aspects of in-person workshops to our virtual
		workshop, during the workshop day we will have a dedicated Slack channel for introductions and virtual
		coffee breaks in which we will try to foster social interaction and discussion on Slack and Zoom.
    </P>

	<p style="text-align:justify">
      We will select four papers among all accepted ones for 10-minute contributed talks. Each paper to be
		presented in the poster session will have a 2-minute spotlight introduction, followed by a poster
		exhibition during lunch break and after closing remarks. Finally, in the panel discussion, we will
		ask our invited speakers to discuss questions from the audience that are collected beforehand.
	</P>

	<p style="text-align:justify">
	The detailed schedule will come soon.
